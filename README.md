Algorithmic training is the basis to efficient programming. It gives the fundamentals and can at the same time become very elaborated.

This folder gathers a set of algorithmic problems that I solved and pushed on github. Most of the problem presented here are taken from the website https://leetcode.com/ or https://www.hackerrank.com/. Thus I have taken care of verifying that the code is correct and efficient by submitting my solution on the website.

Each notebook contains the introduction of the problem and the solution to the presented problem.
